# Setting Up the File
After opening Glyphs, a window with different glyph sets will appear for you to choose which alphabet you want to make, or you can open this window later through _File > New from Glyph Sets..._

Select Thai and say _YES_ to _Prepare glyphs_

(For first time user) Before diving into editing, there are some modules you need to install for the future plugins to work. You can access them through _Window > Plugin Manager_

Then this window will appear. Go to _Modules_ located next to the search box. Then install all 4 modules.

### Setting Auto Hint Area (?)
After finishing a character, it's time to define body height and overshoot values. This is useful as the rest of the consonants will have heights to depend on and the vowels and tones will be easier to position. You can do this through _Font Info_. Then go to _Masters_ tab, scroll down to _Metrics_ and click the _+_ symbol on the right. A new _undefined_ input will appear. Simply click on it, then choose _others_ for the _Metrics type_ and add a _Custom Name_. In this example, I put Thai.
